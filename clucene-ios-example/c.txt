h1 can reuturn the coorect string a.pdf, but if it returns to the codes where it was called, after a while system reports 'double free * set a breakpoint in malloc_error_break to debug'

I checked a long time and foudn that if I removed the code

ttt=[s0 substringWithRange:NSMakeRange(i, 1)];

everything will be Ok (of course getSubStringAfterH can not returns the corrent result I expected.), no error reported.

I try to fix the bug a few hours, but still no clue.

Welcome any comment

Thanks interdev
